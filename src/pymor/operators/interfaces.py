class OperatorInterface(ImmutableInterface, Parametric, Named):
    '''Interface for parameter dependent discrete operators.

    Every discrete operator is viewed as a map ::

        L(Î¼): R^s -> R^r

    Attributes
    ----------
    dim_source
        The dimension s of the source space.
    dim_range
        The dimension r of the range space.
    invert_options
        `OrderedDict` of possible options for `apply_inverse()`. Each key
        is a type of inversion algorithm which can be used to invert the
        operator. `invert_options[k]` is a dict containing all options
        along with their default values which can be set for algorithm `k`.
        We always have `invert_options[k]['type'] == k` such that
        `invert_options[k]` can be passed directly to `apply_inverse()`.
    linear
        True if the operator is (known to be) linear.
    type_source
        The `VectorArray` class representing vectors of the source space.
    type_range
        The `VectorArray` class representing vectors of the range space.

        ----------
        U : VectorArray
            `VectorArray` of vectors to which the operator is applied.
        ind
            If None, the operator is applied to all elements of U.

            which the operator is to be applied.
        mu
            The parameter for which to evaluate the operator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        V : VectorArray
            Left arguments.
        U : VectorArray
            Right arguments.
        V_ind
            If None, the operator is applied to all elements of V.
            Otherwise an iterable of the indices of the vectors to
            which the operator is to be applied.
        U_ind
            If None, the operator is applied to all elements of U.
            Otherwise an iterable of the indices of the vectors to
            which the operator is to be applied.
        mu
            The parameter for which to evaluate the operator.
        product
            `Operator` representing the scalar product.
            If None, the euclidean product is chosen.
        pairwise
            If False and V and U are multi-dimensional, then form is applied
            to all combinations of vectors in V and U, i.e. ::

                L.apply2(V, U).shape = (len(V_ind), len(U_ind)).

    def apply_inverse(self, U, ind=None, mu=None, options=None):
        '''Apply the inverse operator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        U : VectorArray
            `VectorArray` of vectors to which the inverse operator is applied.
        ind
            If None, the inverse operator is applied to all elements of U.
            Otherwise an iterable of the indices of the vectors to
            which the operator is to be applied.
        mu
            The parameter for which to evaluate the inverse operator.
        options
            Dictionary of options for the inversion algorithm. The
            dictionary has to contain the key `type` whose value determines
            which inversion algorithm is to be used. All other key-value
            pairs represent options specific to this algorithm.
            `options` can also be given as a string, which is then
            interpreted as the type of inversion algorithm.
            If `options` is `None`, a default algorithm with default
            options is chosen.
            Available algorithms and their default options are provided
            by the `invert_options` attribute.

        Returns
        -------
        `VectorArray` of length `len(ind)` and dimension `self.dim_source`

        Raises
        ------
        InversionError
            Is raised, if the operator cannot be inverted.

        num_coefficients
            In case of `coefficients == None`, the number of linear coefficients
